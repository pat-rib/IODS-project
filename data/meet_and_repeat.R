# Load the datasets (BPRS and RATS) into R:
BPRS <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KimmoVehkalahti/MABS/master/Examples/data/BPRS.txt", sep  =" ", header = T)
RATS <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KimmoVehkalahti/MABS/master/Examples/data/rats.txt", header = TRUE, sep = '\t')

# Look at the column names, the structure, and summaries of the datasets

str(BPRS)
# The data-frame has 40 observations and 11 variables. The dataset is taken from Davis (2002). The subjects were 40 male randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. The subjects received a rate on the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) measured before treatment began (week 0) and then at weekly intervals for eight weeks. 

str(RATS)
# the dataset has 16 obs and 13 variables. The data is from a nutrition study conducted in three groups of rats (Crowder and Hand, 1990) puted on different diets, where each animalâ€™s body weight (grams) was recorded repeatedly (approximately weekly) over a 9-week period. 
summary(BPRS)
# the variables 'treatment' and 'subject' are not aligned. The variables related to weeks are aligned. 
summary(RATS)
# same observation about the variables: weeks are aligned. ID and Group are not.

# Convert the categorical variables of both data sets to factors. (1 point)

# Convert the data sets to long form. Add a week variable to BPRS and a Time variable to RATS
BPRSL <-  BPRS %>% gather(key = weeks, value = bprs, -treatment, -subject) %>% mutate(week = as.integer(substr(weeks,5,5)))

# Compare the long dataset version with their wide form versions.
# Check the variable names, view the data contents and structures, and create some brief summaries of the variables.
